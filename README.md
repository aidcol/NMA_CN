# Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience [COMPLETED TUTORIALS]
This repository is a collection of condensed versions of the completed tutorials part of [Neuromatch Academy's Computational Neuroscience course](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) offered in 2022. Tutorials are also annotated with notes for personal reference. 

During NMA 2022, I participated in daily group-interactive tutorials learning the mathematics and practical implementation of modeling neural data with statistical and machine learning, biological modeling of dynamical systems in neuroscience, and other computational methods including Convolutional Neural Networks, Bayesian Inference, Hidden Markov Models, and Reinforcement Learning.

The full tutorials and their solutions can be found in this [public repository](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content) published by Neuromatch
Academy (NMA).
